# How would you print just the 10th line of a file?
#
# For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:
#
# Line 1
# Line 2
# Line 3
# Line 4
# Line 5
# Line 6
# Line 7
# Line 8
# Line 9
# Line 10
# Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
# Line 10
# [show hint]
#
# Hint:
# 1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
# 2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

# Solution:

## 使用awk
## 16ms
awk 'NR==10' file.txt

## 使用sed
## 9ms
sed -n 10p file.txt

## 使用head/tail完成（tail -n +10表示第10行起以后的内容）
## 9ms
head -n 10 file.txt | tail -n +10
